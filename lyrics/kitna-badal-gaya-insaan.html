        let a = `Dekh teri sansaar ki haalat kya ho gayi Bhagwan
Look, what has become of Your world, Oh God
Kitna badal gaya insaan
How much humanity has changed

◇◇◇
Suraj na badla, chand na badla
The sun hasn't changed, the moon hasn't changed
Na badla yeh aasman
Nor has this sky changed
Kitna badal gaya insaan
How much humanity has changed
Bhagwan, kitna badal gaya insaan
Oh God, how much humanity has changed

◇◇◇
Aaya tha tu ban ke bacha
You came as a child
Khela tha tu galyon mein
You played in the streets
Bada hua tu, shaitaan bana
You grew up, became a devil
Kaisa bigad gaya insaan
How humanity has spoiled

◇◇◇
Loot raha hai, khoon baha raha hai
It is looting, shedding blood
Nafrat ki aag jala raha hai
It is igniting the fire of hatred
Apne hi bhaiyon ko
Its own brothers
Maar raha hai insaan
Humanity is killing

◇◇◇
Mandir-Masjid, Girjaghar
Temple-Mosque, Church
Sab mein baant diya hai
It has divided everything
Mazhab ke naam pe
In the name of religion
Lada raha hai insaan
Humanity is fighting

◇◇◇
Dharti pe insaaniyat ka
On earth, humanity's
Naam-o-nishan nahin
There is no trace
Andhere mein kho gaya
It has been lost in darkness
Kaisa roshni ka makaan
What a house of light

◇◇◇
Kitna badal gaya insaan
How much humanity has changed
Bhagwan, kitna badal gaya insaan
Oh God, how much humanity has changed`;
