let a= `Maine Dil Se Kaha, Dhoond Laana Khushi
I told my heart to find me some happiness
Nasamajh Laya Gum, To Yeh Gum Hi Sahi
Silly heart brought back sorrow, then sorrow it is
&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;

Maine Dil Se Kaha, Dhoond Laana Khushi
I told my heart to find me some happiness
Nasamajh Laya Gum, To Yeh Gum Hi Sahi
Silly heart brought back sorrow, then sorrow it is
Maine Dil Se Kaha, Dhoond Laana Khushi
I told my heart to find me some happiness
&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;

Bechaara Kahan Jaanta Hai
What does the poor heart know
Khalish Hai Yeh Kya Khala Hai
About pain and emptiness
Shehar Bhar Ki Khushi Se
Compared to the joy of the city
Yeh Dard Mera Bhala Hai
My sorrow is much better
Jashna Yeh Raaz Na Aaye
I'm unable to enjoy these celebrations
Mazaa Toh Bas Gam Main Aaya Hai
I can only find enjoyment in the sorrow
&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;

Maine Dil Se Kaha, Dhoond Laana Khushi
I told my heart to find me some happiness
Nasamajh Laya Gum, To Yeh Gum Hi Sahi
Silly heart brought back sorrow, then sorrow it is
&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;

Kabhi Hai Ishq Ka Ujaala
Sometimes there's light of love
Kabhi Hai Maut Ka Andhera
Sometimes there's darkness of death
Bataao Kaun Bes Hoga
Tell me what disguise it'll be
Main Jogi Banu Ya Lutera
Should I become a saint or a thug
Kayi Chehre Hai Is Dil Ke
This heart has many faces
Najaane Kaunsa Mera
Don't know which one is truly mine
&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;

Maine Dil Se Kaha, Dhoond Laana Khushi
I told my heart to find me some happiness
Nasamajh Laya Gum, To Yeh Gum Hi Sahi
Silly heart brought back sorrow, then sorrow it is
&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;

Hazaaron Aaise Phaasle The
There were thousands of distances
Jo Tai Karne Chale The
That I wanted to travel
Raahe Magar Chal Padi Thi
But the the roads went on
Aur Peeche Hum Rah Gaye The
And I was left behind
Kadam Do Chaar Chal Paaye
I was only able to take two to goir steps
Kiye Phere Tere Mann Ke
So I circled around your memories
&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;

Maine Dil Se Kaha, Dhoond Laana Khushi
I told my heart to find me some happiness
Nasamajh Laya Gum, To Yeh Gum Hi Sahi
Silly heart brought back sorrow, then sorrow it is
Maine Dil Se Kaha, Dhoond Laana Khushi
I told my heart to find me some happiness
Nasamajh Laya Gum, To Yeh Gum Hi Sahi
Silly heart brought back sorrow, then sorrow it is`;
