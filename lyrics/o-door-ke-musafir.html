        let a = `Chale aaj tum jahaan se
From where you leave today,
Hui zindagi paraayi
Life has become estranged (or foreign/alienated).
Tumhe mil gaya thikaana
You have found your destination/place,
Humein maut bhi na aayi
But even death hasn't come to us.
◇◇◇
O door ke musafir
Oh, distant traveler,
Hum ko bhi saath le le re
Please take us along too.
Hum ko bhi saath le le
Take us along,
Hum reh gaye akele
We are left alone.
O door ke musafir
Oh, distant traveler,
Hum ko bhi saath le le re
Please take us along too.
Hum ko bhi saath le le
Take us along,
Hum reh gaye akele
We are left alone.
◇◇◇
Tune woh de diya gham
You have given such sorrow,
Bemaut mar gaye hum
That we have died without a proper death.
Dil uth gaya jahaan se
The heart has risen (moved away) from this world,
Le chal humein yahaan se
Take us away from here.
Le chal humein yahaan se
Take us away from here,
Kis kaam ki yeh duniya
What is the use of this world,
That plays with life (or trifles with life)?
Hum ko bhi saath le le
Please take us along too.
Hum reh gaye akele
We are left alone.
◇◇◇
Sooni hain dil ki raahein
The paths of the heart are desolate/empty.
Khaamosh hain nigaahein
The gazes (eyes) are silent.
Naakaam hasraton ka
Of unfulfilled desires,
Uthne ko hai janaaza
A funeral procession is about to rise (start).
Uthne ko hai janaaza
A funeral procession is about to start,
Chaaro taraf lage hain
All around, there are gatherings/fairs
Barbaadiyon ke mele re
Of ruin/destruction.
Hum ko bhi saath le le
Please take us along too.
Hum reh gaye akele
We are left alone.
O door ke musafir
Oh, distant traveler,
Hum ko bhi saath le le re
Please take us along too.
Hum ko bhi saath le le
Take us along,
Hum reh gaye akele
We are left alone.`;
